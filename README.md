![Pattern](propcomp.JPG?raw=true)

This is a ulitity Java app I created for quickly comparing two .properties files.
It seaches both files for the same keys, collects and sorts all of them, then shows every difference in a console window.

It is best used from a Total Commander custom toolbar button.
Select two files on both sides, then press the previously configured button to compare.

Command: cmd /k "java PropComp"
Parameters: %X%P%N %X%T%M
Start path: ...\PropComp\
